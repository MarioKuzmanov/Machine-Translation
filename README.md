## Setup
In order to run the project locally, you will need to at least install `streamlit`. Clone the project at a folder, open it 
and then type `streamlit run main.py` in the command line. Now, you can explore my work in any modern browser.

## Workflow

Now, that you have what you need and successfully managed to build and run, you will be able to see this screen:

You can enter a word (only with cyrillic characters) and get its transcription.

Example: 

![images/home2.png](images/home2.png)

Translation : **пантера - panther**
